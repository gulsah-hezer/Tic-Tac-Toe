#STEP 1: Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list where each index 1-9 with a number on a number pad.
#So you get a 3 by 3 board representation.

#STEP 2: Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker  as 'X' or 'O'.Think about using while loops to continually ask
#until you get a correct answer.

#STEP 3: Write a function that takes in the board list object  a marker ('X' or 'O') and desired position (number 1-9) and assign it to board.

#STEP 4: Write a function that takes in a board and a mark ('X or 'O') and then checks to see if that mark has won.

#STEP 5: Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first.You may want to lookup random.randint().Return a string of 
#which player went first.

#STEP 6: Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.
